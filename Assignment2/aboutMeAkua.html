        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300"> I am from the Eastern Region of Ghana, specifically from the beautiful town of Kwahu, 
            known for its stunning mountains and pleasant weather. Although my roots are there, I have spent most of my life in Accra, the vibrant capital city, building my capacity in
            the heat of life.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">I have a deep passion for technology, particularly system security, and am always exploring ways to contribute to making our digital world safer. 
            I am also quite handy and enjoy hobbies like hair braiding and cooking.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300"> I love beautiful sceneries and often find relaxation in traveling to new places to enjoy the peace and serenity they offer. And guess what?
             The safest day of the week is Wednesday&ndash;because that is the day I was born!
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300"> If all jobs paid equally, I would still choose to work in <em>Tech</em> &ndash; it is where my heart is!
