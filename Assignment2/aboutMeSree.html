        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">Hello, My name is Sreegar Prasad Ravi. I am a postgraduate student pursuing a degree in cyber security. I am from the southern region of India.
            In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various activities. These include watching movies and television shows, listening to indie music, cooking, and hiking. My favorite film is “Dinner in America,” which chronicles the story of a punk rocker who becomes fugitive and encounters his devoted fan along the way. Their relationship develops into a romantic love affair.
            Occasionally, I indulge in reading, primarily fiction literature. I find that reading fiction allows me to immerse myself in the narrative by vividly imagining the characters and their experiences. Thank you</p>
